# json-to-ts.nvim

json-to-ts.nvim is a Neovim plugin that automatically converts TypeScript object expressions into TypeScript type definitions. It leverages Treesitter to parse object expressions within your TypeScript files and recursively generates type definitionsâ€”helping you quickly and accurately create types from existing object structures.

## Features

- **Automatic Type Generation:** Scans the TypeScript object expression where your cursor is placed and converts it into a TypeScript type.
- **Recursive Parsing:** Handles nested objects and arrays, creating separate type definitions for nested structures.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works directly within your TypeScript files (requires filetype `typescript`).

## Requirements

- **Neovim:** Version 0.5 or later is recommended.
- **Treesitter:** Ensure you have Treesitter installed and configured for TypeScript.

## Installation

You can install json-to-ts.nvim using your favorite plugin manager.

### Using Lazy

```lua
return {
  'ask-786/json-to-ts.nvim',
  config = function()
    local json_to_ts = require('json-to-ts')
    vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>jt', json_to_ts.generate, { desc = 'Convert Object to TS Type' })
  end,
}
```

## Usage

1. **Open a TypeScript File:**
   Make sure the filetype is set to `typescript` or `typescriptreact`.

2. **Place Your Cursor:**
   Position your cursor inside a TypeScript object expression in the file.

3. **Run the Conversion Command:**
   Execute the following command:
   ```vim
   :lua require('json-to-ts').generate()
   ```
   The plugin checks that you are in a TypeScript file and that the cursor is within an object expression. It then generates the corresponding TypeScript type definitions and appends them at the end of your file.

## Example

Given the following TypeScript object expression in a TypeScript file:

```typescript
export const data = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true,
  roles: ["admin", "editor"],
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
  },
};
```

Running `:lua require('json-to-ts').generate()` will generate type definitions similar to:

```typescript
export type Address = {
  street: string;
  city: string;
};

export type Root = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  roles: string[];
  address: Address;
};
```

These definitions are appended to the end of your current file, giving you an immediate reference for type checking and further development.
